 ek. Panels. Pitches. Pings. Your brain feels like a tab you forgot to close
 .\nIf you have to explain what you do one more time, you might explode. So 
 now what?\nZen out or burn out.\nThe meditative walk is a slow, tech-free w
 alk through Central Park. Phones on airplane mode. No pitches. No pretendin
 g to be ‚Äúon.‚Äù\nJust actual humans, moving slowly, enjoying nature and breat
 hing like it‚Äôs 1996.\nJoin a crew of ambitious, slightly-fried New Yorkers 
 as we unplug, walk, and remember how to be human again.\n\nHosted by Kyle F
